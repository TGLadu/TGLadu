Make this resume faang style and ats optimized

I'll help you transform your resume into a FAANG-style, ATS-optimized format. Here are the key improvements:

FAANG-Style ATS-Optimized Resume
Code 
Key Changes Made for FAANG/ATS Optimization:
1. Formatting & Structure:

Clean, simple formatting without tables or graphics (ATS-friendly)
Clear section headers with consistent formatting
Added GitHub link placeholder (essential for tech roles)
Quantified achievements wherever possible
2. Technical Skills Section:

Created dedicated technical skills section (critical for ATS keyword matching)
Listed programming languages, technologies, and concepts separately
Added relevant coursework keywords (Pyret, data structures, algorithms)
3. Projects Section:

New Addition: Leveraged your actual coursework (binary trees, probability, logic) as projects
Used action verbs (Implemented, Developed, Designed)
Highlighted technical complexity and problem-solving
Included specific technologies and methodologies
4. Enhanced Bullet Points:

Started with strong action verbs
Added quantifiable metrics (100+ transactions, 30% increase, 25+ players)
Focused on impact and results, not just duties
Used STAR method where possible (Situation, Task, Action, Result)
5. ATS Optimization:

Included keywords from job descriptions: algorithms, data structures, OOP, Git
Avoided special characters and complex formatting
Used standard section headers ATS systems recognize
Listed skills in comma-separated format for easy parsing
Next Steps:

Add your actual GitHub and LinkedIn URLs
Consider adding more personal coding projects (build something and host on GitHub)
Contribute to open-source projects
Add any coding competition participation (LeetCode, HackerRank, etc.)
For each application, customize the skills section with keywords from the specific job description
can you put this all in a formatted pdf

I can't directly create a PDF file, but I can help you create one! Here are your best options:

Quick Solutions:
1. Google Docs (Recommended - Easiest)

Copy the resume content from the artifact above
Paste into Google Docs
Use File → Download → PDF
Google Docs handles formatting well and is ATS-friendly
2. Microsoft Word

Copy content into Word
Use File → Save As → PDF
Ensures compatibility with ATS systems
3. Online Resume Builders (ATS-Optimized)

resume.io - Free templates, ATS-friendly
flowcv.com - Clean, modern templates
rxresu.me - Open-source, completely free
4. LaTeX (For tech-focused look)

Use Overleaf.com with templates like:
Jake's Resume (very popular for FAANG)
Deedy Resume
AltaCV
Pro Tips for PDF Creation:
✅ Do:

Use standard fonts (Arial, Calibri, Times New Roman)
Save as PDF (not print to PDF)
Keep it to 1 page
Test the PDF in an ATS parser (like Jobscan.co)
❌ Avoid:

Text boxes or images
Headers/footers with important info
Multiple columns (can confuse ATS)
Fancy graphics or icons
